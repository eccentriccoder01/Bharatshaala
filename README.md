## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

> The repo contains a React frontend and a Flask backend. Follow these steps to run both locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9+ and pip
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### 1) Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eccentriccoder01/Bharatshaala.git
cd Bharatshaala
```

### 2) Backend setup (Flask + SQLite)

Important: The backend package uses relative imports (e.g., from .config import Config). To avoid the ‚Äúattempted relative import with no known parent package‚Äù error, run Flask by importing the backend as a package.

a) Create a Python virtual environment and activate it
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
python -m venv backend\venv
backend\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv backend/venv
source backend/venv/bin/activate
```

b) Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
# Razorpay SDK (required at runtime)
pip install razorpay
```

c) Make backend a package (if not already)
```bash
# Create an empty __init__.py so 'backend' is importable as a package
# Windows
type NUL > backend\__init__.py
# macOS/Linux
touch backend/__init__.py
```

d) Configure environment variables

Create backend/.env (optional) and set secrets. Defaults exist in config.py but you should override in development.

```env
# backend/.env (optional but recommended)
SECRET_KEY=change-me
JWT_SECRET_KEY=change-me-jwt
CORS_ORIGINS=*
# If you want to use SQLAlchemy later:
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///bharatshaala.db
# Razorpay keys (test keys are fine)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
```

e) Initialize SQLite (tables)
The database module will create required tables on import in many paths, but you can safely run:
```bash
# From repo root (while venv is active)
python - << "PY"
import backend.database as db
# Create the commonly used tables
try:
    db.create_user_table()
except Exception: pass
try:
    db.create_invitationcodes_table()
except Exception: pass
try:
    db.create_inventory_table()
except Exception: pass
try:
    db.create_orders_table()
except Exception: pass
print("SQLite initialized at backend/sql.db")
PY
```

f) Run the Flask server
Run Flask from the repo root so Python imports backend as a package:
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:FLASK_APP="backend.base:api"
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"
python -m flask run

# macOS/Linux
export FLASK_APP="backend.base:api"
export FLASK_ENV="development"
python -m flask run
```

Server will start at http://127.0.0.1:5000

Note: backend/.flaskenv in the repo points to base.py directly. When running as a package, prefer the explicit FLASK_APP=backend.base:api shown above to avoid import issues.

### 3) Frontend setup (React)

Open a second terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend dev server runs at http://localhost:3000 and proxies API calls to Flask via the existing proxy in frontend/package.json:
```json
"proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
```

---

## üîÅ Typical Dev Workflow

1. Start Flask backend (http://127.0.0.1:5000)
2. Start React frontend (http://localhost:3000)
3. Frontend will proxy API calls to the backend automatically
4. Edit React code and see live reload; restart Flask when editing backend code as needed
